# Higher or Lower Game 🎮

A Python console game where the player guesses which account has more followers.
The game continues as long as the player guesses correctly.

This project is part of my Python learning journey.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

- Two accounts are shown (A and B)
- Each account has a name, description, and country
- The player guesses which one has more followers
- If the guess is correct, the score increases and the game continues
- If the guess is wrong, the game ends and the final score is shown
